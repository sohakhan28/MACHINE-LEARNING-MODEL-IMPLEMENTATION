# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION
This project demonstrates spam detection using Python and scikit-learn. A dataset of 100 messages (50 ham, 50 spam) is used to train a text classification model. It covers preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluation, serving as a beginner-friendly introduction to NLP and machine learning.
