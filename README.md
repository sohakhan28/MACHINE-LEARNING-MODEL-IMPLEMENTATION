This project demonstrates spam detection using Python and scikit-learn. A dataset of 100 messages (50 ham, 50 spam) is used to train a text classification model. It covers preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluation, serving as a beginner-friendly introduction to NLP and machine learning. A machine learning classifier is then applied to distinguish between normal (ham) and spam messages, achieving reliable accuracy on the test data. The project demonstrates the complete workflow of dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction, making it a beginner-friendly introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and text classification. It can be extended further with larger datasets, advanced models, or deep learning techniques to build more robust spam detection systems.
